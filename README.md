# ```acods_vis``` Visualization software stack used to generate imagery for the Australian Carbon Water Observatory

This code base was created in 2013 during a consultancy to CSIRO in which the author created the imagery library used by the interactive viewer (http://goo.gl/E1HMqf) on the Carbon Water Observatory web site.  The national-scale maps comprise tens of thousands of images for multiple meteorological and hydrological quantities, spanning over a century of simulation output, sampled monthly.  These images were generated by running one of the applications in this code base at scale on CSIRO's burnet and pearcy supercomputers.  The code base is sufficiently flexible that it was tested successfully at visualising the same data at not only the continental scale but to also generate maps by Australian State/Territory, over 200 Catchments, and Natural Resource Management (NRM) regions.  The latter, finer-scale maps were not published online.  The code base was also used to create continental-scale animations using ```ffmpeg```. 

The code was originally developed using model output from the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) and is capable of processing data from it (c. 2013) and CSIRO's BIOS-2 model.

Further details are to be found in the file ```ORIGINAL_README.txt```.

Beware that **this is old, Python 2.x code** and is placed here as a matter of historical record.
